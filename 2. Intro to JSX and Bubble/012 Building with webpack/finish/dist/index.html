<!-- we want to use webpack for jsx tranforming to js (which babel-cli does without webpack as well), loading css, transpiling scss to css, loading json, using import statements; and doing all these at one http request

in order to transpile jsx to js before run time, we can use module bundlers like webpack as an alternative to babel-cli
webpack creates a bundle file which packages script, dependecies, css and json into one file, thus making only one request

we first created webpack.config.js file and added babel-loader
then we locally installed the packages of babel-loader, webpack and webpack-dev-server at once using command line: npm install babel-loader webpack webpack-dev-server --save-dev
in order to create bundle.js file we ran webpack command but when we ran webpack command we encountered a problem so we either install webpack globally (npm install -g webpack) and then run webpack command or we dig webpack out from node_modules folder using this command node_modules\.bin\webpack
on this index.html we changed our src to the new bundle.js file, changed type and removed the babel-core script source
to use webpack server efficiently (ie to have the web page automatically loaded when we edit & save index.js (not bundle.js) inside src folder and to run server by just typing npm start) we replaced "httpster -d ./dist -p 3000" with "./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server" inside package.json.

notlar:
- projede webpack komutu en son kullanılır. webpack-server proje esnasında kullanılır ki src folderda yaptığımız değişiklik anında browserda gözüksün 
- webpack komutu kullanınca oluşan bundle.js file size src folder size a göre değişir
- bundle.js file yaratılınca index.html doğrudan launch edilebilir veya httpster ile serve edilebilir
