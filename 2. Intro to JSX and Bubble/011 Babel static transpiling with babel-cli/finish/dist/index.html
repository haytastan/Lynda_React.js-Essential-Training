<!-- 
we are trying to transform jsx to js before run time to get faster by using babel-cli.
we first targeted the finish directory using cd command
we later created package.json file with npm init command (node.js shud be installed)
we installed babel-cli both locally and globally with commands, npm install babel-cli --save-dev     and     npm install -g babel-cli  
we placed the index.js file into newly created src folder.
in order to overcome compatibility issues we created .babelrc file and wrote what is inside there. then we locally installed the packages of babel-preset-latest, babel-preset-react and babel-preset-stage-0 at once using command line: npm install babel-preset-latest babel-preset-react babel-preset-stage-0 --save-dev
now that babel-cli package is installed we do our transformation and create a js file inside dist folder by typing command, babel ./src/index.js --out-file ./dist/bundle.js
on this index.html we changed our src to the new bundle.js file, changed type and removed the babel-core script source
to launch server easily we changed the scripts obj inside package.json so that we can start the server by just typing npm start in finish folder
