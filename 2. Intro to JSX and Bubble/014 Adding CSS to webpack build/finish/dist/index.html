<!-- we can bundle our css using webpack so that we dont have to make additional http requests
we first created hello.css and goodbye.scss files (webpack transpile scss into css) and typed the content.
then we configured webpack.config.js file and added 2 groups of loaders for css and scss
we later installed packages with this command: npm install style-loader css-loader autoprefixer-loader sass-loader node-sass --save-dev
lastly we edited lib.js file by adding our class names hello and goodbye as well as importing links for hello.css and goodbye.scss files
to launch our server we typed npm start

(eventually we happen to use webpack for jsx tranforming to js which babel-cli had done, loading css, transpiling scss to css, loading json, using import statements; and doing all these at one http request)
